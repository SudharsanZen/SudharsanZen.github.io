## About

Hi there! Welcome to my page!
<br><br>
My name is Sudharsan, I am a 4th year CSE Undergrad Student from India.<br>
As you might’ve noticed, I am a HUGE game development enthusiast and I love every aspect of game development (and I mean it!).
<br><br>
I've tried to acquire as many skills as I could since I was an itty-bitty little boy. The progress was slow, but my desire to know how everything works kept me going.
Over the years, I’ve delved into various aspects of Game Dev, both the artist’s side and the programmer’s side. I spent so much time learning each of the many skills that are required to make a game and tried to master everything (which is not a good idea, had to learn it the hard way). The more and more I learned, the more and more I found what I truly wanted to do, you guessed it, I wanted to make my own game engine, which introduced me to the world of graphics programming and I’ve never loved anything more.
<br><br>
I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaKav0cMu-KH3slylWL1Mdw"><em class="link">YouTube</em></a> channel where I upload my Engine’s updates and occasionally some Unity tutorials. Feel free to check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaKav0cMu-KH3slylWL1Mdw">here</a>.
<br><br>
I also have an ‘<a href="https://www.artstation.com/sudharsanyuvaraj"><em class="link">Artstation</em></a>’ page where I rarely post any artworks, but since I claimed that I also have some experience with the artistic side of things, I broke out of my shell and posted it for the people to actually see and confirm the fact themselves! So yeah, I do have some experience with 3D modeling, rigging, sculpting, Texturing, animation, and rendering stuff.
